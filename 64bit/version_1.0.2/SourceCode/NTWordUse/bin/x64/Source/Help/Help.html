    <h3><a id="mozTocId762603" class="mozTocH3"></a>1. What is it?</h3>
    <p>If you have learnt Greek, you will have had to plough your way through
      various tables that tell you how a specific word works. Nouns not only
      have gender and belong to one of several classes of nouns, but they also
      change their form depending on whether they are singular or plural and
      what role they play in a sentence. The grammatical construct used to
      describe this last set of variations is <strong>case</strong>.</p>
    <p>So, for example, you will have learned to <strong>decline</strong> the
      second declension masculine word, &#955;&#972;&#947;&#959;&#962;, and the first declension feminine
      word, &#959;&#7984;&#954;&#943;&#945;, as follows:</p>
    <div align="center">
      <table width="80%" cellpadding="1" border="1">

    </div>
    <p>Similarly, verbs <strong>conjugate</strong> (much as they do in Spanish
      or German). Verbs are even more complex because they have different tenses
      (much as English, such as present, imperfect or future), moods (e.g.
      indicative, imperative, subjunctive) and voice (active, passive and a
      rather confusing <strong>middle</strong>).</p>
    <p>The text books provide idealised tables of nouns, verbs and adjectives,
      sometimes showing forms that would be used <em>if they existed in the
        text</em>. So, NTWordUse allows you to display similar tables of
      declensions and conjugasions <em>as they actually occur in the New
        Testament</em>. We hope that this will be of help to students in
      learning New Testament Greek but also as a research tool, to see how a
      word is <em>not</em> used as well as how it <em>is</em> used.</p>
    <p>As an extra aid, usage in the Septuagint (LXX) has been (optionally)
      added. So, if a word is used in the NT, you can see how it is used in both
      bodies of work, should you choose. </p>
    <h3><a id="mozTocId637853" class="mozTocH3"></a>2. So what does NTWordUse do
      - the main window?</h3>
    <p>When you start NTWordUse, after a short period where it initialises
      itself and asks you to be patient, you will be faced with a fairly busy,
      small window:</p>
    <p align="center"><img src="01_Main_Screen.JPG" alt="Main Window" height="696"

        width="375" /></p>
    <p>This is made up of three areas:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A word list (top left)</li>
      <li>A list of what we have called "Grammatical Categories" (e.g. noun,
        verb, adjective, etc.)</li>
      <li>An extremely simple and simplified Greek "keyboard"</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Let's explain each of these areas:</p>
    <h4><a id="mozTocId284847" class="mozTocH4"></a>2.1 The Word List</h4>
    <p>You'll see in the screenshot that the category, noun, has been selected.
      As a result, the word list will contain only nouns. The list, by default,
      will contain all the nouns used in the New Testamant. We'll explain what
      you do with this list in a moment.</p>
    <h4><a id="mozTocId357159" class="mozTocH4"></a>2.2 Grammatical Categories</h4>
    <p>It is hoped that these are fairly obvious. Selecting a different category
      will refresh the word list with all the words in the New Testament
      belonging to that category.</p>
    <h4><a id="mozTocId772301" class="mozTocH4"></a>2.3 The "keyboard"</h4>
    <p>(We're putting the word, keyboard, in quotes because it barely qualifies
      as a keyboard but it is a way of easily enteing Greek characters without
      you having to install a second keyboard on your PC.)</p>
    <p>Because the word lists <em>are</em> every word in a given category, you
      will often want to narrow the list down. This "keyboard" allows you to do
      that.</p>
    <p>Suppose, for example, that you want to investigate the use of &#955;&#972;&#947;&#959;&#962;. To
      reduce the size of the list, we can type the letter &#955;:</p>
    <p align="center"><img src="02_Selecting_l.JPG" alt="Selecting l" height="696"

        width="375" /></p>
    <p>Well, that helped but it's still a sizable list, so let's add &#959; (note: we
      won't bother with the accent):</p>
    <p align="center"><img src="02_Selecting_lo.JPG" alt="03_Inserting_lo" height="696"

        width="375" /></p>
    <p>Now the list is a manageable size and I can easily select the word I'm
      interested in.</p>
    <p>Note also that we can keep track of what we've typed in the text below
      the "keyboard". If we press the <strong>clear</strong> button or change
      the grammatical category, the buffer containing our preselection text will
      be cleared and we will see the full list once again.</p>
    <h4><a id="mozTocId11849" class="mozTocH4"></a>2.4 Verbs</h4>
    <p>As we have already mentioned, verbs are more complex than other
      grammatical categories and we need to mention what happens if you select
      the category, <strong>verb</strong>. The main window will expand to
      provide additional options:</p>
    <p align="center"><img src="04_Verbs.JPG" alt="Verbs" height="690" width="771" /></p>
    <p>NTWordUse has added some options to the right of the normal window and
      expanded the window so that you can see them. You can choose to view one
      or more tenses. If you select no tenses,when you analyses the selected
      word, the application assumes that you want to look at everything and
      fills all the tenses in for you. Similarly, you can choose one or more
      moods. Again, if you choose no moods, all will be selected (except
      participles).</p>
    <p>You can also investigate participles (ordered by tense) but you cannot
      look at them at the same time as other moods. This is because the other
      parts of the verb conjugate but a participle effectively declines. </p>
    <h3><a id="mozTocId453460" class="mozTocH3"></a>3. What next - Analysis?</h3>
    <p>Once you have selected the correct grammatical category, required
      tense(s) and mood(s) (in the case of verbs), you can select the specific
      word in the word list that you want to analyse and then click on the <strong>Analyse</strong>
      button. (Alternatively, you can double click on the selected word - but
      make sure it <em>is</em> selected.) This will open a second window which
      provides detail on the word.</p>
    <p>Let's take the first declension feminine noun, &#7936;&#947;&#940;&#960;&#951;, as an example. Once
      we've selected the word, analysing it will result in the following window:</p>
    <p align="center"><img src="05_Analysis-agape.JPG" alt="Agape" height="577"

        width="771" /></p>
    <p>The different colours are indicators of the roll played by the LXX as
      well as the NT. (Just in case you need reminding when using the utility,
      there is a kind of "key" near the bottom of the window.) The colours of
      the following significance:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>If the word is in red, that specific form of the word is not used in
        the LXX;</li>
      <li>If the word is in grey, the specfic form is not used in the NT (only
        in the LXX)</li>
      <li>If the word is in orange, it is found in that form in botrh NT and
        LXX. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Note, however, that some of the possibilities are blank. This means that
      not used in either NT or LXX, so it doesn't occur in our analysis.</p>
    <p>If we had chosen a verb, the analysis would inevitably have been a little
      more complex. Consider the verb &#7936;&#947;&#945;&#960;&#940;&#969;:</p>
    <p align="center"><img src="06_verb_example.JPG" alt="A verb example" height="690"

        width="771" /></p>
    <p>Our analysis window would look something like this:</p>
    <p align="center"><img src="07_Analysis-agapaw.JPG" alt="agapaw" height="577"

        width="771" /></p>
    <p>Now, there's more of it because we've included all tenses and moods.
      Notice also that there are several tabs at the top of the window. By
      default we show the active voice but you can select other voices simply by
      clicking on the relevant tab. (Note: normally, one or more of the tabs
      will give a completely blank analysis: if there are no middle uses of the
      verb, for example, then it will be blank.)</p>
    <p>Note also that deponent verbs will be reported as middle.</p>
    <h4><a id="mozTocId689741" class="mozTocH4"></a>3.1 Saving the analysis</h4>
    <p>Clicking on the <strong>Save as CSV</strong> button will allow you to
      save the analysis of the specific word as a tab-delimited file. You will
      be prompted with a normal <strong>Save As ...</strong> dialog. Make sure
      you remember where you are putting the resulting file so that you can
      retrieve it later. The idea is that you can load the analysis into another
      application of your choice.</p>
    <p>You need to be aware that the analysis will be saved in Unicode (UTF8)
      format and, so, any application into which you import the file must be
      able to work with this format. For example, you cannot simply load it into
      Excel by double clicking (because that doesn't recognise the tabs but it
      also won't recognise UTF8), but you can import it through the Data tab
      (then <em>Get External Data</em>). </p>
    <h3><a id="mozTocId345796" class="mozTocH3"></a>4. Wait! There's more</h3>
    <h4><a id="mozTocId222698" class="mozTocH4"></a>4.1 References</h4>
    <p>If you select a specific form of the amalysed word and right click on it,
      you will be provided with a list of all the occurrences of that form in
      the New Testament.</p>
    <p>For example, we have analysed &#7936;&#947;&#940;&#960;&#951;. If we do so again and right click on
      the accusative singular form, &#7936;&#947;&#940;&#960;&#951;&#957;, and we see this:</p>
    <p align="center"><img src="09_References_Kept.JPG" alt="Refs kept" height="537"

        width="673" /></p>
    <h4><a id="mozTocId816625" class="mozTocH4"></a>4.2 Saving the References</h4>
    <p>In exactly the same way as before, you can save this list as a
      tab-delimited file. Click on the <strong>Save as CSV</strong> button.</p>
    <h4><a id="mozTocId959654" class="mozTocH4"></a>4.3 Closing the Window </h4>
    <p>We haven't really discussed the various close buttons - because they
      normally do exactly what you would expect. However, we are so far down the
      tree of activity that we have provided a means of closing all the windows
      back to the first window: clicking on <strong>Back to base</strong> will
      do exactly that.</p>
    <h3><a id="mozTocId95881" class="mozTocH3"></a>5. One step more</h3>
    <p>If you highlight a particular chapter and then click on the <strong>Display</strong>
      button, NTWordUse will open one more window with the text of the whole
      chapter:</p>
    <p align="center"><img src="10_A_Chapter.JPG" alt="A Chapter" height="588" width="612" /></p>
    <p>You can resize this window to suit.</p>
    <p>Note that all verses that contain the specific form of your selected word
      are displayed in bold text. You also have the <strong>Back to base</strong>
      option at this level.</p>
    <h3><a id="mozTocId538454" class="mozTocH3"></a>6. Multiple Windows</h3>
    <p>At all levels (other than the base window) you can return to earlier
      windows without closing the latest window and you can open a second,
      third, etc. window:</p>
    <p align="center"><img src="11_Multiple_Windows.JPG" alt="Multiple Windows"

        height="847" width="1025" /></p>
    <p>This has been provided deliberately so that you can easily make
      comparisons across categories. Be aware, though, that opening lots of
      windows can make your screen a bit difficult to manage and the <strong>Back
        to base</strong> option may not remove all the windows that you have
      opened. </p>
    <h3><a id="mozTocId783314" class="mozTocH3"></a>7. Options </h3>
    <p>You may have been muttering to yourself, "The colours are all well and
      good but they won't help some people who have specific problems with
      colour.&quot; We have provided the ability to change the way the different
      categories of words are displayed. Clicking on the <strong>Options</strong>
      button on the main form will take you to this dialog:</p>
    <p align="center"><img src="11_Options.jpg" alt="Options" height="375" width="409" /></p>
    <p>In particular, you can change the different categories of results to
      bold, italic and normal (black) text .</p>
    <p>Note also that, if you really don't like the involvement of the
      Septuagint in everything, you can choose simply to use only NT data.
      Unselecting the top option will remove all signs of LXX involvement in the
      analysis.</p>
    <p>These options will be saved to disk and will be remembered for future
      sessions of the application. </p>
    <h3><a id="mozTocId829684" class="mozTocH3"></a>8. Credits and Concluding
      Comments</h3>
    <h4><a id="mozTocId244290" class="mozTocH4"></a>8.1 Where has the data come
      from - credits, etc.</h4>
    <p>The application is provided for free use. This can only be done because
      so much is now available in the public domain. But that doesn't mean that
      we can simply ignore the efforts that have gone into producing the data in
      usable form or even, in some instances, the intellectual property
      contained in the data.</p>
    <p>The Greek text of the New Testament that is used here is derived from
      text that (I understand) is ultimately traced back to CCAT (The Center for
      Computer Analysis of Texts) at Pensylvania University - although this
      itself was based on efforts of a number of pioneers (see the article at <a

        href="https://www.sbl-site.org/publications/article.aspx?ArticleId=246"

        target="_blank">https://www.sbl-site.org/publications/article.aspx?ArticleId=246</a>
      for example). More directly, it seems to have been the responsibility of
      SBL ( which is still copyright of the Society of Biblical Literature - see
      <a href="http://www.sbl-site.org" target="_blank">http://www.sbl-site.org</a>)
      although, as far as I can see, it is essentially Westcott &amp; Hort.
      Although I find it morally doubtful to claim copyright on the Greek text
      of the New Testament (as opposed, for example, to critical appendices and
      textual analysis), I am happy to acknowledge the enormous amount of work
      done over the years. </p>
    <p>As implied by some of these comments, so many variations in presentation
      now exist on the internet that it is difficult to be precise about where
      some of it has come from and what path it has taken. A practical
      implication is that<strong> it doesn't do away with your need to use an
        up-to-date version that represents modern scholarship</strong>: you will
      find some words used in the text are now considered, at best, less likely
      varients. </p>
    <p>One further name that needs to be mentioned is James Tauber. He has done
      an amazing job in providing a well-constructed parsed version that has
      been invaluable. You can see some details at <a href="http://jtauber.com/new_testament_greek/"

        target="_blank">http://jtauber.com/new_testament_greek</a> and you can
      learn more of him and his work from there. </p>
    <h4><a id="mozTocId236171" class="mozTocH4"></a>8.2 A caveat </h4>
    <p>In developing the application, we have identified some errors in the
      parsing of words in the LXX data. It was only a handful of words but there
      are likely to be other errors that did not show up in our analysis. Be
      aware that there may be such errors and make independent checks when
      basing decisions on this analysis. Our aim is to make the process of
      learning Greek and using the language more straightforward, but there is
      never a replacement for consulting good texts, lexicons commentaries and

    <h4><a id="mozTocId964142" class="mozTocH4"></a>8.3 Who am I</h4>
    <p>I studied Physics at London University (Bedford College - alas, no more),
      Biblical Studies at Manchester University and Theology at Oxford
      University. I have had a love affair with computers since my physics
      studies in 1968 and, more specifically, started working on Biblical texts
      and the computer at Manchester in 1979, when working for an MA. I've spent
      several years recently developing this and some related applications in an
      attempt to make the most of publically available information. </p>
    <p>This software <em>is</em> free. I'm too lazy to put together a properly
      formed licence agreement but the usual open source stuff applies, limited
      only by any claims by originators of source data. </p>
    <p>I hope you find this useful. </p>
